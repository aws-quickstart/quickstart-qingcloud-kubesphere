.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to administer the KubeSphere platform and Amazon EKS environment.*
* In the private subnets:
** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in an Auto Scaling group. KubeSphere core components and your applications run on worker nodes.
* An Amazon EKS cluster, which provides the Kubernetes control plane.
* AWS IAM roles to help you securely control access to AWS resources.
* Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
