== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance remains running so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for the stack. Ensure that you delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer, or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q.* How to change the language.

*A.* Choose the user name from the top-right corner of the console, and choose *User settings* for language options. KubeSphere console supports English, Spanish, simplified Chinese, and traditional Chinese.

*Q.* Deploying second cluster into a Region causes the "Regional Resource" stack to fail.

*A.* When deploying a stack into a Region where you already deployed a cluster using the Quick Start. You need to set "PerRegionSharedResources" to "No", this stack once deployed will be used by all subsequent deployments in that Region.

*Q.* Deploying second cluster into an Account causes the "Account Resource" stack to fail.

*A.* When deploying a stack into an Account where you already deployed a cluster using the Quick Start. You need to set "PerAccountSharedResources" to "No", this stack once deployed will be used by all subsequent deployments in that Account.
