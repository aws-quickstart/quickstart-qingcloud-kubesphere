KubeSphere is a multitenant, enterprise-grade, container platform with full-stack automation, operation, and DevOps workflows. It provides developer-friendly web interfaces, which can help enterprises build more robust and feature-rich platforms that includes the most common functionalities needed for enterprise Kubernetes workloads.

This Quick Start is powered by AWS CloudFormation templates that help IAM users automatically provision Amazon EKS environments on a new or existing VPC. This gives IAM users the ability to manage Amazon EKS clusters through the KubeSphere console, which provides the following capabilities:

* Kubernetes resource management
* Multicloud and multicluster management
* DevOps (continuous integration and continuous delivery based on https://www.jenkins.io/[Jenkins^])
* Application lifecycle management
* An app store
* Edge computing (based on https://kubeedge.io/en/[KubeEdge^])
* Rich observability for monitoring, logging, auditing, alerting, and notifying
* A service mesh for distributed microservices (based on https://istio.io/[Istio^] and https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger^])
* Enterprise multitenancy
* Storage, network, and registry management
* Automatic scaling
